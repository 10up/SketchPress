Keynote template for quickly creating awesome WordPress admin interface mockups

Keynote --- the presentation software from Apple --- makes a surprisingly good resource for doing a surprising amount of things well and beyond presentations. One of these is website mockups.

The short reasoning is this: traditionally tools limited practitioners to producing one of the following: High fidelity mockups that required a lot of work, or low fidelity wireframes and sketches that could be rapidly created.

The short reason for this repo is that Keynote allows for both, but in order to be most effective, it helps to have tools available. I _highly recommend_ that you go read and watch the material on http://keynotekungfu.com.

==How to use this==
1. download (or clone, or whatever) and open in Keynote
2. View the master slides (View->Show Master Slides)
3. Copy elements from this presentation to your new presentation/mockup.

There are a bunch more "pro" tips around how to make this workflow the best. Again, I'd highly suggest watching the material on keynotekungfu.

Feel free to contribute back with your own elements.

Last note, I started this project using WordPress 3.4 as a reference, and then migrated to 3.5 beta. There are some inconsistencies, but the idea is to use the trunk version of WordPress as a reference for new UI elements whenever possible and prudent.
